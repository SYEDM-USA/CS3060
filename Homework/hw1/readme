This is your readme file. Edit this file to let the user (e.g. TA) know 
how to read/run your files/code, expected input/output, and more (if necessary). 

First the user enters two lines of code which will be saved in a file named savedFile.txt 

and then 

The user is asked to write a name of a file the file created for test is word.txt
for which the program will output an appropriate text . to change the output change what is in the file word.txt


Then the program outputs the square of numbers from 1 to 100 

then the program asks the user for a number and then outputs a calculation fo heads and tails ratio like the homework asks  

then the program reads a file names story.txt to output the number of words, the number of unique words and then the 3 rd most frequent word in my case is "a".
