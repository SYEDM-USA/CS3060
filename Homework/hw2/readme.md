# Assignment2Ruby
#Task1.rb is a function that will run with the following command
# ruby task1.rb item-to-search (i.e. string x) file-to-search-in
#the file in my repository is name file_task1.txt

#Task 1 - Output 
# the line in which the word was found and then the line number 
#ruby task1.rb Ismail file_task1.txt
#Cambodia urged Kuala Lumpur to "double-check" the diagnosis, but Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said the 83-year-old woman had already been tested twice. "Our protocol is actually world-class ... it's a positive," she told a press conference.
#This is line number 35

#Task 2 - this program conatins all the necessary functions and calculations given in part
# a to e . Outputs given when asked. 
#The random numbers are a different function which is passed like asked
#output clear when task runs

#Task3  contains 2 function that calculates the run time for two different functions 
#using the benchmark library in Ruby . we calculate the Time that each function takes and 
#output it. 
#The iterative function is about 8 lines of code, but takes only 0.000005 seconds to compute 
#whereas the recursive function is 2 lines of code, but takes 3 seconds to code
#iterative -   0.000009   0.000000   0.000009 (  0.000006)
# recursive -  3.354845   0.000000   3.354845 (  3.356759)


#Task 4 This program takes the family tree that is passed through the new tree function. the tree is processed recursively and then then the tree is printed out using block method 
#ggrandparent
#grandparent1
#parent1
#child1
#parent2
#child2
#child3
#grandparent2
#parent3
#child4
#parent4
#child5
#child6



#Task 5 - THis program first sets up the parent class and its children class. using concepts 
# of polymorphism we first define the initialize function in the parent class and do similar work in the 
# child class we then just push what we collect from the child class and push it to the parent class. 
# then then program creates a list of the different objects and then later goes through 
#the each function to calculate the sum of the area of the different shapes 
#both the rectangle and circle are made in the area_out function. The output of area is calculated at the end using  the each method
